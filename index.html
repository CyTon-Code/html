    <p>My name is Timothy Bochkor, I am 17 years old, I study at the
university. I am a chatty and lazy person. I was always picky,
nobody liked it ... And I was also the dumbest and laziest in
my class. At school, he was interested in computer science,
loved to play, but refused to understand a lot: for example,
programming languages, to be honest, I did not even understand
what it was then.</p>
