		My name is Timofey Bochkor, I am 17 years old, I study at the
		university. I am a chatty and lazy person. I was always picky,
		nobody liked it ... And I was also the dumbest and laziest in my
		class. At school he was interested in computer science, loved to
		play, but refused to understand a lot: for example, programming
		languages, to be honest, I did not even understand what it was
		then.
